Now Al-khateeb, an assistant professor of computer science, design and journalism at Creighton University, has received a three-year, $585,000 grant from the Air Force to learn more about how social media mobs form and succeed." - <span style="font-size:18px;"><i>Omaha World Herald (2022)</i></span> </p>

        <p id="experience"> Within my time on the Mobs Research Team, I had the pleasure of designing databases, back-end routing, security functionality, and utilizing API's for a better user experience. </p>

        <h3> Database Design </h3>

        <p> This project was my first large scale foray into database design. We needed a solution that would be flexible, secure, but also capable of scaling as the application grew. </p>

        <p> Since the application was based around Flask, the decision was made to use MySQL since it integrated nicely. </p>

        <p> User data was collected and stored within our database in order to support a smooth experience when using the application. </p>

    <div class="backendrouting">

        <h3> Backend Routing </h3>

        <p> Due to the nature of Flask, rendering webpages is handled with routes</p>

        <p> My responsibility was to create routes that allowed the user a simple workflow while also being capable of handling large data queries. </p>

        <p> Due to the nature of the data that we were handling, secuirty was top of mind. This meant jumping through hoops with salting and securing connections. </p>

    <div class = "APIs">

        <h3> APIs </h3>

        <p> One of my favorite things that I worked on was the usage of the <a href = "https://www.sendgrid.com" target="_blank"><strong>SendGrid</strong></a> API to send users a password reset link. </p>

        <p> This was some of my first experience working with APIs in an engineering setting, so this was invaluable experience. </p>

        <p> The end result was a seamless experience for the user that meant they could reset their password without any hassle. </p>
